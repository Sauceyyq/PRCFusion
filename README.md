## 📖 Abstract

Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from distinct modalities to enhance scene representation. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved significant progress, most existing approaches are constrained by a single-stage reconstruction paradigm. 

To address these challenges, we propose **PRCFusion**, a fusion network that establishes a multi-task framework via a progressive refinement cascade mechanism.

### ✨ Key Contributions

- 🔄 **Progressive Refinement Cascade Mechanism:** A progressive decomposition strategy that divides the fusion task into *coarse perception* and *fine perception* stages, utilizing a semantic mask for guidance.
- 🧩 **HDDF Module (Hierarchy-aware Dual-Domain Fusion):** Utilizes wavelet domain spectral decoupling for shallow features and a semantic-guided bidirectional cross-attention mechanism for deep features.
- ⚖️ **TDMO Strategy (Task Decoupling Meta-Optimization):** A strategy specifically designed to address gradient dominance issues during multi-task joint training.
