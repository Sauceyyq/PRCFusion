📖 Abstract

Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from distinct modalities to enhance scene representation. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved significant progress, most existing approaches are constrained by a single-stage reconstruction paradigm. To address these challenges, we propose **PRCFusion**, a fusion network that establishes a multi-task framework via a progressive refinement cascade mechanism.

**Key Contributions:**

* **Progressive Refinement Cascade Mechanism:** A progressive decomposition strategy that divides the fusion task into coarse perception and fine perception stages, utilizing a semantic mask for guidance.
  
* **HDDF Module:** A Hierarchy-aware Dual-Domain Fusion module. It uses wavelet domain spectral decoupling for shallow features and a semantic-guided bidirectional cross-attention mechanism for deep features.
  
* **TDMO Strategy:** A Task Decoupling Meta-Optimization strategy designed to address gradient dominance issues during multi-task joint training.
