## 📖 Abstract

Infrared and visible image fusion integrates complementary multimodal features to preserve structural details and highlight salient targets, thereby facilitating downstream vision tasks. However, existing task-oriented methods face two major limitations: insufficient cross-modal complementary aggregation for key target regions, and gradient interference between tasks during joint optimization. To address these challenges, we propose PRFusion, a progressive refinement image fusion network collaborative with segmentation tasks, aimed at enhancing the depiction of key target regions and improving support for downstream perception.

### ✨ Key Contributions

- 🔄 **Progressive Refinement Cascade Mechanism:** A progressive decomposition strategy that divides the fusion task into *coarse perception* and *fine perception* stages, utilizing a semantic mask for guidance.
- 🧩 **HDDF Module (Hierarchy-aware Dual-Domain Fusion):** Utilizes wavelet domain spectral decoupling for shallow features and a semantic-guided bidirectional cross-attention mechanism for deep features.
- ⚖️ **TDMO Strategy (Task Decoupling Meta-Optimization):** A strategy specifically designed to address gradient dominance issues during multi-task joint training.
